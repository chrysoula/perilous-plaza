TODO Next up conversations that you can Watch or Interrupt/Join In, usually through several turns (which don't trigger movement but may consume Spoons). 
TODO also can't forget to set them Engaged so they don't walk away mid scene.


TODO come back and clean up the data structures and function shit.


TODO ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE MESSAGES FOR CHARACTERS. That's probably another switch again.





TODO /* NEXT UP MOVEMENT OF CHARACTERS (kinda done)

First of all, Fixed characters move rarely while Wandering characters move often.
Fixed characters take a short walk: they move to another location selected from a small set, hang around a couple of turns, and go home.
Wandering charaacters move around every 3-4 turns, and may have special movement rules like following somebody around.
Possibly movement can be suspended in case of drama. I feel like what I actually want to do is going to produce a lot of special cases.
Wandering and Fixed may not be useful lists in the game if i'm just going to sweep through all characters every turn.

Once upon a time... The vision: a town interface, with different shops available and ongoing updates at each shop based on what you do there.

- Everything's great!

I can randomly select from a LIST type variable, just as I can from a complete list, as such: {LIST_RANDOM(Lune)}

I can get the entire set of a list using LIST_ALL on a value, as so: {LIST_ALL(Plaza)}

Lune's LuneProp is: {LuneProp}

{ LuneProp ^ Shops:
- Plaza: Lune is sitting in the Plaza. 
- (): You changed the name again.
}

TashProp contains location derived from an intersection as so: {TashProp ^ Shops }.
