/* ---------------------------------

Ok, a premise: On each shopping trip, the player has a list of things to pick up or do. There are several items for each Shop, but the day's list is a subset of those items. Some items you can get from multiple sources, but sometimes only after unlocks.

Items are acquired through narrative if available when the player enters a shop.

A list may not need to be cleared every day but there's some kind of cost to not clearing it, and only a variable/limited number of stops a day are possible. Visiting somebody without business can influence their opinion about you, even if you don't have personal interaction.

In addition, not everybody is at work. You can arrive in an empty store, or a store where the proprieter has stepped out but other customers are waiting. Wandering characters may show up in a Location and interact with you or each other.

Let's see. Tash is a wandering character who is mostly unemployed. Lune is a musician which isn't employed currently, but she only rarely leaves her spot in the square. At any given time, Tash is in one of a few locations. He will stay there two or three turns and sometimes interact with somebody else present if the player is there. These interactions may be sequenced. The player will have opportunities to get involved and influence situations. 
Six stops only, which is not the same as a turn.
How to limit choices without using javascript?
How about a priority system?

In Ink Patterns they talk about filtering lists; might this be used to filter choices?
Can choices be stored in a list?
Counting entries in a list with a certain substring (see Patterns in book)
Also keep in mind switches as dictionaries.

Once upon a time... The vision: a town interface, with different shops available and ongoing updates at each shop based on what you do there.

- Everything's great!

I can randomly select from a LIST type variable, just as I can from a complete list, as such: {LIST_RANDOM(Lune)}

I can get the entire set of a list using LIST_ALL on a value, as so: {LIST_ALL(Square)}

Lune's LuneProp is: {LuneProp}

{ LuneProp ^ Shops:
- Square: Lune is sitting in the square. 
- (): You changed the name again.
}

TashProp contains location derived from an intersection as so: {TashProp ^ Shops }.
